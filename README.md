# Assign-Five

Task 1 creates a Dictionary with student name and their marks as the key value. then it asks user to input a name and checks in the same dictionary using loops. If the name is found, it prints the corrosponding marks and if not found, it returns as the Student not found.

Task 2 creates and prints a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then it slices it in half and print it and again it reverse it and prints it agian.

Thanks
